# Tech debt

Tech debt in Poetic Fiddle is filed as GitHub issues labelled
`pw::type:tech-debt`, resolved by closing the issue with a real closing
keyword (e.g. `Fixes #<n>`) in the pull request that fixes it, alongside a
`td-record` block in that pull request's body — the squash-merge commit
then carries the record into `main`'s own immutable history.

`tech-debt/` is a **frozen historical archive**: every record this
repository ever allocated under its `PPpfid` scope while debt was tracked
as a per-item register, before that policy changed. Its files are never
added, edited, deleted, or renamed — `git log --follow tech-debt/<id>.md`
remains each one's audit trail. The frozen format, ID grammar and
scope-code registry are documented in
[docs/TECH-DEBT-REGISTER.md in Poetic-Poems/poetic](https://github.com/Poetic-Poems/poetic/blob/main/docs/TECH-DEBT-REGISTER.md).
